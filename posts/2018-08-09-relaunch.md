I [built my own blog](https://github.com/typedrat/typedrat-site) a while ago, and while I did some cool stuff with it, I never really got the motivation to finish the site fully. I'd rather work on other programming projects than tweaking details of a trivial CRUD web app, and my programming time has been rather limited of late, especially as far as programming for leisure is concerned.

This should maintain all of the same basic features, but with a very simple Hakyll configuration. The fact that it was easily possible to do this in a day somewhat shows why trying to make something from scratch was a mistake.

Plus, I have exciting content coming soon, with a report on ~~what I did this summer~~ my Cabal Google Summer of Code project.
